# Attitude Estimator

This is a Go version of the awesome C++ [attitude_estimator](https://github.com/AIS-Bonn/attitude_estimator) library, created by students
at [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en/university). It is their
code - we simply needed a Go version for one of our projects, so we rewrote it.
